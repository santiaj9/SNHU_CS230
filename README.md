**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a company thatr has a game called Draw It or Lose It available on Android. They've reached out to our company for help in expanding their game to a web-based game that is able to serve multiple platforms. Their requirements inclue the following:
    o A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
    o Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
    o Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
    o Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I think I did a good job in planning on what to put in each section and making sure my messaging was consistent throughout.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The most helpful part of the design document for me was the UML diagram, because that helped ensure that I had included everything I was supposed to.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
The one part I would likely revise is the Evaluation Section, and that would be to find more specific information for each block.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interpreted that the user's needs were for flexibility and performance and implemented them into my software design by giving a lot of options between operations systems, memory strategies, and other capabilities. It is important to consider the users when designing because they will ultimately determine what is necessary for a successful application. If the application does not work on a user's system well, then the application is a failure. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
While designing the software, I thought mostly about how the end users my interact with the application. I think in the future I would analyze who the expected users are supposed to be and what their requirements may be before designing the application.
